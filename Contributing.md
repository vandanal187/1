Make sure the code is clearly commented with jsdoc style comments and also has no jshint errors or warnings (take a look at the .jshintrc file to see the jshint settings). 

To contribute examples, please follow the current style of the examples as closely as possible. Add your example to the ExampleList.js file for it to appear in the drop-down and index page.
