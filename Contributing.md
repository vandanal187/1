# Contributing

Bug fixes, examples, and contributions are welcome!

Please get in touch (yotammann@gmail.com) and tell me what features you'd like to see or contribute to. 

And make all pull requests to the `dev` branch. 

## Examples

To contribute examples, please follow the current style of the examples as closely as possible. Add your example to the ExampleList.js file for it to appear in the drop-down and index page. 

## Style

Make sure the code is clearly commented with jsdoc style comments and also has no jshint errors or warnings (take a look at the .jshintrc file to see the jshint settings). 

All classes have a dispose method where all their members are disconnected, disposed and nulled. 

#### Nitpicky

* 4 space TAB indentation. 
* 1 empty line between function definitions.
