# Tone.js Wiki

## Installation

There are a few ways to install and use Tone.js using either `npm` or `bower` or the Tone.js CDN. Tone can also be used with or without requirejs. For full instructions, take a look at the [installation guide](Installation)

## Working with Tone.js

To get started sequencing and synthesizing notes, take a look at a basic [arpeggiator walkthrough](Arpeggiator).

### Time

Time in Tone.js lets you think in musical timing instead of seconds. Every method which takes time as an argument also accepts [Time](Time). The value of Time is relative to the current tempo of the Tone.Transport. 

### Signals

Signals plays an important role in the library. Understanding [Tone.Signal](Signals) will help you create tightly synchronized and interestingly automated applications. 

## [Contributing](Contributing)

The easiest way to contribute is by sending issues on Github. If you already have a good understanding of Tone.js, making tutorials which I can link to from the github page would be very welcome. 

If you'd like to contribute a change or module beyond a basic pull request, please send me an email.

I haven't published my TODO for Tone.js, but I will if people are interested in tackling specific problems.
