#p5.Tone
p5.Tone is a [p5.js](p5js.org) compatible version of [Tone.js](tonejs.org/), a Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser. p5.Tone allows for use of the p5 [preload()](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/preload) with operations that require asynchronous loading such as Tone.Player, Tone.Convolver, and Tone.Sampler.

#Using p5.Tone

download tone here //link to tone 

To use p5.Tone, first include the library in your HTML header after p5.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./p5.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./p5.Tone.js"></script>
```

p5.Tone does not attach itself to p5 or to the window as other libraries do. In order to invoke a Tone.js function, call the function directly on Tone. For example:

```
var oscillator = new Tone.Oscillator();
```

If you are using Tone.Player, Tone.Convolver, or Tone.Sampler, be sure to load the buffers for these functions within the preload function. Below is an example of loading and playing a soundfile.

```
var player;

function preload(){
	player = new Tone.Player("./drums.mp3").toMaster();
}

function setup() {
	createCanvas(640, 480);
}


function draw() {
	if(mouseIsPressed){
		player.start();
	} else {
		player.stop();
	}
}
```
