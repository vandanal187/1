Tone.js is a Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser. The architecture of Tone.js aims to be familiar to both musicians and audio programmers looking to create web-based audio applications. On the high-level, Tone offers common DAW (digital audio workstation) features like a global transport for scheduling and timing events and prebuilt synths and effects. For signal-processing programmers (coming from languages like Max/MSP), Tone provides a wealth of high performance, low latency building blocks and DSP modules to build your own synthesizers, effects, and complex control signals.

#p5.Tone
p5.Tone is a [p5.js](p5js.org) compatible version of [Tone.js](tonejs.org/). p5.Tone allows for use of the p5 [preload()](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/preload) with operations that require loading, such as Tone.Player, Tone.Convolver, and Tone.Sampler.

#using p5.tone

download tone here //link to tone 

To use p5.Tone, first include the library in your HTML header after p5.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./p5.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./p5.Tone.js"></script>
```

p5.Tone does not attach itself to p5 or to the window as other libraries do. In order to invoke a Tone.js function, call the function directly on Tone. For example:

```
var oscillator = new Tone.Oscillator;
```

If you are using Tone.Player, Tone.Convolver, or Tone.Sampler, be sure to load the buffers for these functions within the preload function. Below is an example of loading and playing a soundfile.

```
		var player;
		function preload(){
			player = new Tone.Player("./drums.mp3").toMaster();
		}

		function setup() {
                        createCanvas(640, 480);
		}


		function draw() {
                        if(mouseIsPressed){
                               player.start();
                        } else {
                               player.stop();
                        }
		}
```
